A **non-exhaustive list** of things that need to be done in order to fully implement the new database.

1. Add all tables featured in the `new_schema` 
2. Add functionality for users to be able to add bank account and categories
3. Refactor CSV uploads to work with the new transaction model
4. Refactor validation.py and all other validation to work with the new models
5. Document database design (er diagram)
